  "readme": "# Component Watcher\n\nA watch utility for Component. It watches a `component.json`, then emits `resolve`, `scripts`, and `styles` events, allowing you to trigger these functions elsewhere.\n\n## API\n\n### var watcher = watch([options])\n\nOptions:\n\n- `root` <process.cwd()> - path where the main `component.json` is located.\n- `development` - if you want to watch for field within the `.development` property.\n- `extensions` - extensions to look up for `scripts` and `styles`. Default `{ scripts: ['js', 'json', 'html'], styles: ['css'] }`.\n- `fields` - fields to look up for `scripts` and `styles`. Default `{ scripts: ['scripts', 'json', 'templates'], styles: ['styles'] }`.\n\n### watcher.start()\n\nStart or restart the watcher. Aliased as `watcher.restart()`. `watcher` starts automatically, so this is unnecessary.\n\n### watcher.stop()\n\nStop the watcher. Aliased as `watcher.close()`.\n\n### Event: resolve\n\nEmitted when a `component.json` file has been changed or a file has been added/removed, meaning you should re-resolve and create new builds.\n\n### Event: scripts\n\nEmitter when a `scripts` file has changed. Meaning you can use your previous `tree` and rebuild.\n\n### Event: styles\n\nEmitter when a `styles` file has changed. Meaning you can use your previous `tree` and rebuild.\n\n## License\n\nThe MIT License (MIT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2014 Jonathan Ong me@jongleberry.com\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in\nall copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
